# HomeX Mobile Test
Hey! Seems you are interested in working at HomeX. This isn't a timed test, take as much or as little time as you feel you need (unfortunately we do need this back to assess you, so do keep that in mind). This is our little test to see what you know, and how you apply your knowledge to a real life use case.
## The Test
Using the Hacker News REST API (not using firebase), you will build an app that displays the top stories from Hacker News in a list. Clicking on a story should open the story's web page so the user can read it. The Hacker News API docs are here: https://github.com/HackerNews/API
## Requirements
* Support iOS and Android.
* Build with cross platform development tools (Xamarin, React Native, or Flutter).
* Display a list of top stories from Hacker News, showing poster name and title.
* List item should be expandable to display comment count.
* Clicking on a list item should open the story in either the device broswer or an in-app broswer tab.
* List should support pull to refresh.
* You can use any libraries or dependencies you would use in a real project.
* Add one other small feature of your choosing.
* If there are any special compile/run instructions, include those.
## Assessment Notes
* Keep it clean, write self commenting code where possible, otherwise add comments where not. 
* Code like you would if you were working on a real team production project.
* It doesn't have to be perfect, but we want to see the quality you would normally put into your work.
* Keep it structured. What structure you use is up to you, but don't just throw everything in one method.
## Submission
To submit the test, ZIP up your project (including this README) and email it to [amanda@homex.com](mailto:amanda@homex.com).
Include any assumptions/comments on how you feel about the test.
